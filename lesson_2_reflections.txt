What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository your files in that directory begin to be tracked. Git starts to keep data on those files. You need to do this so that you can create commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a place where you place files (that are in your repository and thus also in your working directory) that you think you are going to commit before you commit them. It acts as an intermediate step to take before commiting.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    If you're not sure that your changes mark a logical change in your project, you can add them to the staging area, keep working and see how those changes feel in the context of your project as a whole. If they do feel like they mark a logical change you can commit them before you stage any new changes.
